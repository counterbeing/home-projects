#BBotE

This first test will be a triple extraction of a small amount to see where we get. Currently, the only coffee I have in stock is some Peet's pre-ground. I will do more with this later. I'm going to start with some Ice water.

# The Process

I just did a basic vacuum extraction using the [[Buchner Funnel Coffee Extraction v1]]. Worked like a charm. It seems like the vacuum wasn't even entirely necessary, I'm not sure, but i suspect had i let it sit for an afternoon 60% of the liquid would have ended up at the bottom all the same. The vacuum definitely accelerated things.

## Tasting Notes

**Extraction round 1 8AM 2023-06-16:** Tastes like cold brew to me! Definitely a bit burned tasting, but I think that's probably just the nature of using a dark roast. This is making me think I should really be trying with a lighter roast of some kind. I'm afraid that as I continue the extractions I'm going to end up with something that's too potent to drink. I may try cleaning it up with another pass through the filter at the end to see if that makes any changes.

**Extraction round 2 8AM 2023-06-17:** The second extraction is clearly stronger. It's more of the same. It's still *good*, but is starting to require milk to consume.

**Extraction round 3 8AM 2023-06-18:**  Surprisingly similar to round 2. It really hasn't changed that much. It makes me wonder if the liquid is failing to absorb much more of the coffee. Maybe we've reached maximum capacity?

On to the [[Second Batch]].
