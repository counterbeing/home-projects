I've decided to move to grams and milliliters for my measurements. This time I plan on using the ratio:

- 3 parts coffee
- 25 parts water

This is working backwards from my previous recipe. Katie picked up some Big Bang by Peet's. I wanted to try a medium roast and this was on sale, so we're going to give it a go in the half gallon jar and see what happens.

Going to try to get the finest grind my new burr grinder can do.

We'll be starting with: 

- 1250ml water
- 150g fine ground coffee

This is what the grind looks like, just to give an idea. I've set it to the finest grind my grinder can do.

## Results
I'm not sure how much my vacuum sealer is pulling for a vacuum, but the fine grind was difficult to pull through the filter paper. I've moved up in grind for the next two extractions, and it did seem to go at least a bit smoother. I also think it still just takes time. According to a random video on the internet of a brand of vacuum sealer that is not mine, a similar sealer should pull around 25 inHg, assuming that's the case, i'm not actually sure my current glassware should be pushed beyond that.

### Tasting notes
This being a medium roast, was quite a bit more fruity and less burned tasting than the [[First Batch Coffee Extraction]]. I do not think it's very close to [[Black blood of the Earth Coffee]], but we're definitely getting there. It's the best cold brew I've made in my life. It's mighty but not overpowering in a bit of milk.

Somehow I'm hoping it's possible to get something a bit more pure. Time to talk to a chemist!

On to the [[Third batch]]!
