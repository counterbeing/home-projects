A few years back I was absolutely entranced by an art project out in the Black Rock Desert.

This art installation was called [Desert Wave](https://www.squidsoup.org/portfolio/desert-wave/), and people were drawn to it from great distances. The terrible photo above that I took really fails to capture the dynamic, but gentle animations, as well as the sounds.

I've decided to make my own! I had some space in the stair way, and I got clearance from Katie! here we go!

## Goals

- A nice looking box that will mount on the sealing.
- Animations, pretty gentle animations that both provide light for the stair way, and also a pleasant experience.
- Reactivity to motion, an animation should trigger when someone is walking up or down the stairs.

##  The Box

I'm creating a shallow box 70" by 33", and about 2 $^1/_2$" deep.
