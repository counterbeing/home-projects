We're heading out to the family reunion this week, and so it's time to scale up. I'd like to bring a batch of strong cold-brew to the event, especially given the rather warm forecast. The theme for this batch is to brew it for a bit less time before doing each extraction. I'm also using another medium roast, but a different one. 

## The brew plan

- 2500ml water
- 500g fine ground coffee
- Grind set to 6 of 15
